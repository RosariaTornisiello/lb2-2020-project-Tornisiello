# GOR method vs SVM for predicting protein secondary sctructure from amino-acid sequence
This project describes the procedure adopted to generate, implement and compare the Garnier–Osguthorpe–Robson (GOR) method and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to predict protein secondary structure from amino-acid sequence.
It is part of the Laboratory of Bioinformatics course at the International Master course in Bioinformatics (University of Bologna).
